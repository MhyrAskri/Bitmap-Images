## Working With Bitmap Images
<p>In the cmake-build-debug folder we have three bitmap image files called <strong>image0.bmp, image1.bmp, image2.bmp and image3.bmp</strong>, and the code asks us to name one of them as input.</p>
<p>After naming the file, the program creates 4 files in the same folder called <strong>image.bmp, contrast.bmp, hollow.bmp and rotate.bmp</strong>, the first is a copy of the image file and the second is a copy with a higher contrast and the third checks the 9 pixels around a pixel, and if they are all black, whitens the middle pixel and the fourth is for photos that have square dimensions, such as image3.bmp, which is a 90-degree rotated output of the original photo..</p>
<p>There is a complete sample of the work in the same folder.</p>
